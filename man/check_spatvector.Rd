\usage{
check_spatvector(shape, check_size = TRUE, add_overlap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{shape}{Object of class SpatVector to check.}

\item{check_size}{Logical. Whether to check if the area is within reasonable bounds.}

\item{add_overlap}{Logical. Whether the overlap with landmass in percentage should be added as an attribute.
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The input SpatVector, possibly reprojected to EPSG:4326.
}
\description{
This function checks if a given object is a valid SpatVector polygon with
appropriate coordinate system and size constraints, and validates its overlap
with known country boundaries.
}
\details{
The function checks:
- If input is a SpatVector polygon
- If coordinate system is properly defined
- If polygons are valid and non-empty
- If the area overlaps with known country boundaries
- Optionally checks if area is within reasonable bounds
(larger than 10,000 ha but smaller than approximately Brazil)
